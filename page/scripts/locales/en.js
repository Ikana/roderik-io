      aboutContent: `My name is Joaquin Rodrigo Quezada, I am a passionate developer
        with more than 4 years experience on developing tailor made applications,
        focusing on full-stack applications. When I start a new project I
        always strive towards using the right tool for the job, but if any of the
        tools that i know of  is the correct one, I research over the state of the
        art and about what other more accomplished programers have used to solve
        the problem, so I can add it to my repertoire.`,
